# Creating Customer Segments

In this project, unsupervised learning techniques was employed to look for similarities existing between customers, and to segment customers into distinct categories. A dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure was analyzed. One goal of this project was to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
